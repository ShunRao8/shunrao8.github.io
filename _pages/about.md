I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://gsbs.uth.edu/quantitative-sciences/index.htm) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yisheng Li](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/yisheng_li.html). Prior to joining MD Anderson, I worked as a biostatistics undergraduate intern at Boston Children's Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, under the supervision of [Professor Al Ozonoff](https://www.sabetilab.org/alozonoff/) and [Professor Joann Diray-Arce](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/149197). I earned my BS in Statistics-Data Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2021.

My research interests lies in Bayesian Adaptive Design using Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) models in oncology clinical trials. By applying mechanism-based designs, I aim to systematically explore the biological and pharmacological mechanisms of drug effects to optimize dosing strategies, mitigate severe side effects, and ensure optimal therapeutic efficacy.

When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll find me playing basketball, badminton, or piano, and spending time with my dog, Huzai.
