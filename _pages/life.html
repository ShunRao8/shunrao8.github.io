<p>More about my personal interests, hobbies, and life outside of work...</p>

<p>I started off as a national registered badminton player, but after a back injury during a match, I shifted my focus to team sports, especially basketball. In college, I founded the first women’s basketball team and served as the captain for a year, organizing daily practices and coordinating matches with other universities. I was also a varsity member and started in multiple games. Nowadays, I still enjoy playing basketball, and most recently, I led my team to a 3rd-place finish in the 2023 Fall National Asian Women's Basketball Regional Elite Tournament as the captain. Not bad for someone who started with a badminton racket!</p>
<p>Besides basketball, I’m a big foodie! My favorite thing to do when traveling is exploring delicious restaurants in each city I visit. I’m also a huge fan of LEGO, with a collection that has grown so much it now fills an entire display counter. On top of that, I’ve been playing the piano for years and enjoy a wide range of music genres—it’s a great way to unwind and express creativity.</p>
<p>I also have a smart little dog named Huzai, which means "little tiger baby." He's a 2-year-old miniature Goldendoodle who’s lovely, obedient, and always friendly to people. Huzai loves playing tug, catching balls, and, of course, distracting me from work whenever he can!</p>
