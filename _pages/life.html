<p>This is more about my personal interests, hobbies, and life outside of work...</p>

I started off as a national registered badminton player, but after a back injury during a match, I shifted my focus to team sports, especially basketball. In college, I founded the first womenâ€™s basketball team and served as the captain for a year, organizing daily practices and coordinating matches with other universities. I was also a varsity member and started in multiple games. Nowadays, I still enjoy playing basketball, and most recently, I led my team to a 3rd-place finish in the 2023 Fall National Asian Women's Basketball Regional Elite Tournament as the captain. Not bad for someone who started with a badminton racket!
