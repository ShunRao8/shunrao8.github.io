<p><b>Graduate Research</b>: In my current doctoral dissertation research, I am focused on integrating pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) drug action mechanisms into Bayesian adaptive dose-finding designs, specifically for subcutaneously administered drugs. Under the guidance of Dr. Yisheng Li, we propose utilizing a three-level hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis model to derive informative priors for key PK parameters, ultimately enhancing the statistical power of a Phase 2 trial designed to assess drug efficacy against a placebo and identify the optimal dosage. This Bayesian approach is particularly advantageous in early-phase trials with limited data, as it allows for the use of informative priors, enhancing the accuracy of PK-PD parameter estimates and improving overall trial efficiency. By integrating existing PK/PD data across both early-phase and post-marketing trial designs, our study offers a comprehensive evaluation of the dose-toxicity/efficacy relationship in oncology dose-finding trials, thereby potentially improving clinical outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Internship Research</b>: I spent one year conducting research at the Department of Infectious Disease at Boston Children’s Hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Under the mentorship of Dr. Al Ozonoff, I applied innovative computational methods for data integration and cross-cohort validation. As part of this project, I developed an RShiny app to facilitate interactive data visualization, enabling real-time exploration of complex datasets. This tool was instrumental in analyzing data from a collaborative project with the Expanded Program on Immunology in Children - Human Immunology Project Consortium (EPIC-HIPC). My research experience not only deepened my understanding of computational methods but also provided valuable insights into the challenges I may encounter in my future career in biostatistics.</p>
<p><b>Undergraduate Research</b>: I was part of a project in the laboratory of Dr. Baoting Zhu at Kobilka Institute of Innovative Drug Discovery. Dr. Zhu’s laboratory studies the mechanisms of action of certain naturally occurring bioflavonoids to function as reducing co-substrates. During my time in his lab, I correctly modeled proteins and simulated molecular docking processes on the computer. My contributions to this work were included in two publications accepted in European Journal of Pharmacology and Scientific Reports.</p>
