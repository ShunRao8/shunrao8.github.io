**Graduate Research**: In my current doctoral dissertation research, I am focused on integrating pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) drug action mechanisms into Bayesian adaptive dose-finding designs, specifically for subcutaneously administered drugs. Under the guidance of Dr. Yisheng Li, we propose utilizing a three-level hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis model to derive informative priors for key PK parameters, ultimately enhancing the statistical power of a Phase 2 trial designed to assess drug efficacy against a placebo and identify the optimal dosage. This Bayesian approach is particularly advantageous in early-phase trials with limited data, as it allows for the use of informative priors, enhancing the accuracy of PK-PD parameter estimates and improving overall trial efficiency. By integrating existing PK/PD data across both early-phase and post-marketing trial designs, our study offers a comprehensive evaluation of the dose-toxicity/efficacy relationship in oncology dose-finding trials, thereby potentially improving clinical outcomes.
